## About

For my final project with General Assembly I chose to create a React based web-store with a simple Express.js API for getting the products and a JSON database. I took this approach as I wanted to focus my energies on the front-end and use this as an opportunity to familiarise myself with the fundamentals of React in a practical and real-world way. 

I used Stripe for payment authentication and the use-shopping-cart React module for handling the cart logic and context. This streamlined integration with Stripe and simplified the cart functions, but came at the cost of not allowing me the direct access to it's methods and state. Next time I might try constructing my own cart context and logic.

Overall I enjoyed building custom components, creating contexts, utilising state and integrating a few NPM modules while working on this project. The UI is mostly standard CSS with a touch of ChakraUI and is fully responsive.
